# PostgreSQL-Sales
Identifying top products based on the highest profit margins and detecting missing values
In this project, I have worked with public data from a shop to improve my SQL skills in data cleaning.  

Key objectives included:

Converting incorrect data types (e.g., dates stored as TEXT, numerical fields as DOUBLE PRECISION)
Identifying and handling missing values
Analyzing top-performing products by category using RANK() and aggregate functions
Exploring joins and window functions to generate meaningful insights

Example queries included creating a ranked list of the top five products in each category based on total sales and profit. This project strengthened my skills in SQL joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, and real-world data wrangling.
